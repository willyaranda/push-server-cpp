===============

This will be a challenge for myself as I have not touched a real C++ app in a while.

Making the PNS in JavaScript (Node.js) was really fun (and easy) but I think it could perform much better in C++,
and it will also help me to remind some of the great features of C++ as well as learn Boost libraries that I have
never used before.

The code will be spaguetti, bolognesa or even leak everything at startup. This is for fun, learn and testing.

Be aware. Dragons (and silly code) ahead.
